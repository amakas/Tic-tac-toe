# Tic-Tac-Toe Game  

A simple **Tic-Tac-Toe** game built with **plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**, with a minimal backend, playable locally on a single computer.  
The game features a **bot** with a minimax algorithm that almost never loses, with a small chance of making a random move for variability.  

ðŸ”— **Live Demo (deployed on Vercel):** https://tic-tac-toe-28.vercel.app

## Features  

- Play locally against a **bot**  
- Bot uses **minimax algorithm** for near-perfect play  
- Small chance of **random moves** to make the game more fun  
- Simple backend for game state management   
- No frameworks â€” built with **vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS**

## Tech Stack  

- **Frontend:** Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express  
- **Game Logic:** JavaScript (minimax algorithm with optional randomness)

## Notes  

- This project is a **learning exercise** in game logic, algorithms, and front-end development without frameworks.  
- The bot demonstrates the minimax algorithm in practice.  
- Deployed version allows anyone to play without setup.
